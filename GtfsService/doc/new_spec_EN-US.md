Entity: GtfsService  
===================  
This specification is a **temporal version**. It is automatically generated from the  documented properties described in the schema.json condensed into the file `model.yaml`. A temporary `new_model.yaml` file has been created in every data model to avoid impacting into existing scripts. Thus, the specification will be incomplete as long as the schema.json is not updated to the new format (documenting properties). Once updated the `model.yaml` (`new_model.yaml`) needs to be updated as well (automatically) . Further info in this [link](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/specs/warning_message_new_spec.md). As long as it is a provisional format any [feedback is welcomed in this form](https://smartdatamodels.org/index.php/submit-an-issue-2/) choosing option `Feedback on the new specification`  
Global description: **GTFS Service**  

## List of properties  

- `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `operatedBy`: Agency that operates this service. It shall point to an Entity of Type GtfsAgency  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be GtfsService    
Required properties  
- `id`  - `name`  - `operatedBy`  - `type`

## Example payloads    
#### GtfsService NGSI V2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a GtfsService in JSON format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI V2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
```json  
{  
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Service:Malaga:LAB",  
  "type": "GtfsService",  
  "name": "LAB",  
  "description": "Laborables",  
  "operatedBy": "urn:ngsi-ld:GtfsAgency:Malaga_EMT"  
}  
```  
#### GtfsService NGSI V2 normalized Example    
Here is an example of a GtfsService in JSON format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI V2 when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
```json  
{  
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Service:Malaga:LAB",  
  "type": "GtfsService",  
  "operatedBy": {  
    "type": "Relationship",  
    "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:GtfsAgency:Malaga_EMT"  
  },

    "value": "Laborables"  
  }  
}  
```  
#### GtfsService NGSI-LD key-values Example    
Here is an example of a GtfsService in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.
